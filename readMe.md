# ADAS Car Lane Detection

This is a very simple project that uses classical techniques to demonstrate some lane <br>
techniques using OpenCv. I use a random video I found in the internet and hence I cannot provide<br>
pixel to meter feature as I lack the necessary calibration matrices.

The other steps of the pipeline however need no calibration steps and work on raw images.
This is not intended to be<br>
used in any production application, it is merely an exersice for me to practise my c++ skills.
